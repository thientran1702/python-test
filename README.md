## Instructions
In this repository, we have two files:
* `main.py`
* `functions.py`

`functions.py` has a method `validate_word_prefixes`, which its main function is to filter out valid strings that have 
a valid prefix. For various reasons, the function `validate_word_prefixes` has bugs and needs to be fixed.

Your goal is to have all the run cases in `main.py` working. 

Feel free to use any debugging tools or online sources for solutions.
